<h1>The best movies/shows according to Athena</h1>

<h2>My top 3 favourites of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Never have I ever</h3>

<p>
  This show is a teen rom-com. It is about an Indian girl, settled in the US.
  She is a rebel and quite dramatic at first, but the show explains her journey
  through college and how she handles the death of someone really close to her.
</p>

<h3>The bold type</h3>

<p>
  This series has 6 seasons. It is based in New York, and explains the journey
  of 3 empowered women, as they navigate their careers, love life and
  friendship.
</p>

<h3>Mia culpa</h3>

<p>
  This is a spanish romantic drama, and it is easily my favourite movie of all
  time. It is an adaptation of a trilogy, and i can't wait for the next 2
  movies. It is based on the intense, forbidden love story between Noah and
  Nick, both coming from broken homes. They meet each other when Noah's mom and
  Nick's dad get married, making their love incestuous and hence forbidden.
